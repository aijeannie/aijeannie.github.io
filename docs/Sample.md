**Project Goals:**

To create a retail application that allows customers to purchase products online and enables the retail store to manage their inventory, sales, and customer data.
The application will also provide customers with the ability to log in and view their order history, save their credit card information, and manage their shopping preferences.

**Project Architecture:**

**User Interface:** The user interface will be developed using responsive web design principles to provide an optimal viewing experience across all devices and platforms. It will be developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS framework.

**Application Server:** The application server will be the central component of the retail application. It will provide data to the user interface based on the user's requests and will manage all business logic and data access. It will be developed using Node.js and Express.js for the backend.

**Database:** The database layer will be responsible for storing and retrieving data, such as customer data, inventory data, and sales data. It will be designed using Postgres database or any other appropriate SQL or NoSQL database technologies.

**Payment Gateway:** Payment gateway services will be integrated into the application to facilitate safe and secure online transactions. Several third-party payment gateways can be used, including PayPal, Stripe, and other major payment gateway services.

**API Layer:** This layer will enable communication between third-party applications and the retail application. The API layer can be implemented using RESTful API using Node.js.

**Inventory Management system:** This layer will enable the store to manage inventory, track product movements, and replenish stock when need be. This system can be developed using inventory management software like Zoho inventory, and Lightspeed.

**Cloud Platform:** The architecture can also be deployed and managed on a cloud hosting platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
