#  Usage  

AI Jeannie predominantly supports three different features as listed below:

1. Acceptance Criteria Generation for Epics and User Stories
2. Predictive Generation of Epic and User Stories
3. Sequence Diagram Generation


## Acceptance Criteria Generation for Epics and User Stories 

AI Jeannie automates the generation of acceptance criteria based on the project definition. It uses the natural processing language to understand the context of the project definition along with the summaries of Epics and User stories, to generate appropriate acceptance criteria. Users have flexibility to append these acceptance criteria or overwrite the existing description of Epics and user stories, based on their specific needs and preferences. 

Acceptance criteria can be generated for the following issue types:

1. Acceptance Criteria Generation of Epic 
2. Acceptance Criteria Generation of User story


## Acceptance Criteria Generation of Epic

AI Jeannie automates the generation of acceptance criteria for an Epic based on project definition and Epic summary by using Epic prompt template configuration. If users are not satisfied with the generated acceptance criteria, AI Jeannie provides the flexibility to regenerate the acceptance criteria with or without making any changes to the Epic prompt template configurations. This feature ensures that the acceptance criteria can be refined to meet users' specific needs and expectations. 

Here are the steps for generating acceptance criteria for an Epic:

1.	From the JIRA project, click **Create** at the top, to create new Epic as shown below.
