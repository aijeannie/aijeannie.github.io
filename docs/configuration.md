## Project Definition Configuration

Here are the steps to configure the Project Definition for the AI Jeannie plugin:

1. Next, configure the Project Definition for the specific JIRA project board. The Project Definition is used by AI Jeannie to understand the context of the JIRA issues and generate relevant content.

2. Access the Project Definition settings. This may be available within the AI Jeannie plugin configuration, or it may be a separate option in the board settings.

3. Define the fields, criteria, and other project-specific details in the Project Definition. This includes specifying the information that AI Jeannie should consider when generating content for epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria.

4. Save the Project Definition settings once you have configured all the necessary details.

5. You are now ready to use AI Jeannie within your JIRA board. You can generate epic descriptions, user story descriptions, and acceptance criteria based on the configured settings and the context of your JIRA issues.
