Please note that other countries may have higher or lower standards for the protection of personally information, but we will always endeavor to protect such information and take reasonable steps to do so in accordance with this policy and applicable laws, including, (where applicable) utilizing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between its group companies, which requires all group companies to protect personal information being processed from the European Economic Area to an equivalent standard to that required under European Union data protection law.

If your personal information is protected by EU data protection law, you have the following data protection rights which you may be able to exercise by contacting EPAM using the contact details provided under the “Contact Details” heading below and in the right-hand side column:

Right to Delete. You have the right to request that we delete the personal information it has collected from you (and require its service providers to do the same), once a verifiable consumer request is confirmed.
